# Smart-Building-using-IOT
In this project we will provide automatic appliance on/off using PIR sensor. In this project, we will see the Automatic Room Lights using Arduino and PIR Sensor, where the lights in the room will automatically turn ON and OFF by detecting the presence of a human. Internet of things is the physical thing embedded with sensors, softwares, etc.., without human interaction and computer interaction transaction of data over a network; however, it scales up to include smart cities with connected sensors. Utilizing PIR sensors, the lights will consequently turn on and off as indicated by the power of light. Also, with the help of an automatic room light control system, you need not worry about electricity as the lights get automatically off when there is no person  The main components of the Automatic Room Lights project are Arduino, PIR Sensor and the Relay Module.
